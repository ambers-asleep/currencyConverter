# currencyConverter
This was an app programmed in Java using this API: https://www.exchangerate-api.com.

To use the app first enter the currency and then select which currency.

This was the list of currencies: "British Pound (GBP)", "Chinese Yuan (CNY)", "European Euro (EUR)", "Japanese Yen (JPY)", "Mexican Peso (MXN)", "Russian Ruble (RUB)", "Australian Dollar (AUD)", "Canadian Dollar (CAD)", "Swiss Franc (CHF)", "Indian Rupee (INR)"
I didn't use any file reading and just put it in the code's choicebox, this lead to the error of the button never working :p
